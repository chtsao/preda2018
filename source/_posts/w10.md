* Data Vis? How does it relate to Data Analysis?
* You cannot see it until you "see" it
	- Exploratory data analysis
	- Data/Graphical communication
* Examples
  - One variable: say midterm scores, income, salary
  - Two or more variables: (midterm, final), (income, age, gender, education, area); (salary, profession, age, gender, education, area)
